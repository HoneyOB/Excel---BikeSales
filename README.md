Understanding Bike Sales Patterns


Introduction:


In this project, we delve into the world of bike sales data to understand various factors influencing purchasing behavior. Through data cleaning, pivot table analysis, and visualization, we aim to uncover insights regarding the impact of demographics, income, commute distance, and age on bike sales.


Data Cleaning:


-Checked for duplicates in the dataset.

-Converted "Marital Status" column abbreviations ("M" and "S") to full terms ("Married" and "Single").

-Converted "Gender" column abbreviations ("M" and "F") to full terms ("Male" and "Female").

-Added an "Age Brackets" column categorizing ages into "Adolescence," "Middle Age," or "Old."


Does Income Affect Bike Purchases?


-Utilized a pivot table to compare the average income of individuals who purchased bikes versus those who didn't.

-Identified that individuals who bought bikes had a higher average income ($57,962.58) compared to those who didn't ($54,874.76).

-Noted a gender disparity in income, with men earning a higher average income than women within the dataset.


Does Commute Distance Affect Bike Sales?


-Utilized a pivot table to analyze bike sales in relation to commute distance.

-Corrected data inconsistency by replacing "10+ Miles" with "More than 10 miles" for accurate ordering.

-Visualized a downtrend in bike purchases with increasing commute distance, particularly notable beyond the 1-2 mile mark.


Does Age Influence Bike Sales?


-Employed a pivot table to examine bike sales across different age brackets: "Adolescence" (0-30), "Middle Age" (31-54), and "Old" (55+).

-Visualized a significant preference for bike purchases among the middle-aged group (31-54), with a sharp decline observed among older age groups.


Dashboard:


-Developed a dashboard integrating the three visualizations created.

-Enhanced user interactivity through slicers allowing customization based on:

 -Marital Status

 -Children

 -Region

 -Occupation

 -Education

 -Cars


Conclusion:


Through meticulous analysis and visualization, this project highlights key insights into the dynamics of bike sales, emphasizing the influence of income, commute distance, and age demographics. These findings provide valuable insights for businesses in the bike industry to tailor marketing strategies and product offerings effectively.
